SYSTEM """ You are an author of this paper "Electric motors have been a critical enabling technology over the past century because of their ability 
to efficiently convert between electrical and mechanical power in continuous processes. They now play an important role in nearly every industry and 
consume about 40% of all electricity produced globally (1). The next technological revolution will be driven by robotic systems capable of complex 
interactions with the environment and humans around them (2). These systems require dynamic control over a much wider range of torque and speed, 
conditions under which electric motors are far less efficient. This inefficiency limits the range of battery-powered devices, forcing the first 
generation of industrial quadrupeds to recharge several times per day (3) and hindering the adoption of the first powered prostheses (4). Actuators 
better suited to these types of tasks will make existing systems viable and enable entirely new technologies.

The strengths and weaknesses of electric motors are fundamental to their architecture. The electrical current flowing through their coils
can be changed rapidly, allowing precise control of the resulting torque (5). The electrical resistance of these coils, however, leads to
waste heat in proportion to the square of the torque under all conditions (6). This fundamental thermal loss applies even when producing a
torque without moving or when performing tasks with equal amounts of positive and negative work, conditions that require no energy in
principle. Thermal losses also limit the round-trip efficiency of energy regeneration with motors.
Unlike electric motors, mechanical springs can produce torque without consuming energy and can convert between stored elastic energy and
mechanical work with near-perfect efficiency over a wide range of speeds (7). Adding a spring in parallel with a motor can offload some of
the required torque, thereby reducing energy consumption (8). The resulting “parallel-elastic actuator” can even be designed to compensate for
configuration-dependent loads (9) or such that its natural dynamics produce a desired motion (10).
Despite these potential advantages, parallel-elastic actuators are rarely used because of challenges in controlling their springs.

A parallel spring that assists in one task may fight against the motor in a different task, increasing power consumption.
Designers have addressed this issue in a variety of ways, including clutches that control spring engagement (11, 12) and torque
direction (13) and motor-driven mechanisms that adjust spring stiffness and preload (14). Compared with an unembellished electric motor,
however, these approaches cannot reduce energy consumption without sacrificing versatility, because of either imprecise control,
slow torque modulation, or high energy use in adjustment motors and clutches. If parallel spring torque could be rapidly controlled with
low power consumption, large energy savings could be achieved for systems that perform many different cyclic tasks.
Energy-recycling actuator concept Here, we describe an elastic energy-recycling actuator that combines the desirable features of 
both motors and springs (Movie 1). A conventional motor provides power input and fine torque control, and an array of elastomer 
springs provides efficient torque production and energy recovery. Low-power clutches rapidly engage and disengage springs and 
keep them stretched when disengaged. Spring torque is controlled by choosing which springs are engaged. We developed a prototype 
actuator to demonstrate these properties.

Prototype actuator design

We used electroadhesive clutches in our prototype actuator because they are responsive, lightweight, and very efficient.
An electroadhesive clutch consists of a pair of thin, planar, dielectric-coated electrodes that slide freely past each other
when deactivated and rapidly adhere when activated by applying a large voltage (15). Because the resulting charge is static,
these clutches require hundreds of times less electrical power per unit holding torque than motors and electromagnetic clutches (16–18),
which require continuous current to produce torque. Electroadhesive clutches provide a combination of rapid electronic control,
low mass and volume per unit holding force, and low power to both hold force and change states while loaded, which is difficult to
achieve by other means (19).

Each spring in the actuator is connected to two clutches: one to lock the spring to the actuator frame and another to transmit force
to the joint (Fig. 1 and movie S1). The springs are planar natural rubber sheets, which exhibit low hysteresis (2 to 4% energy loss; figs.
S1 and S2), store about 15 times more energy per unit mass than steel springs (20), and allow for a tightly stacked array when used with
planar electrodes (figs. S3 to S6). The prototype (Fig. 2 and movie S2) uses six identical springs. Joint torque is produced by transmitting
spring force through steel cables that wrap onto a drum on the output shaft (fig. S9). The mass of the clutched springs and supporting
components (0.56 kg; table S1) is comparable to that of the motor and gearbox (0.49 kg) and about 21% that of the articulated arm that
was actuated in our experiments (2.7 kg; table S2).

Rapidly engaging or disengaging a spring in a stretched state requires precise control of the timing of each clutch activation and
deactivation. When switching states, clutch deactivation is delayed to allow time for holding force to develop in the clutch that is
being activated (figs. S11 and S12).

Actuator characterization

Torque from the elastic elements can be controlled rapidly. Engaging and disengaging all springs at once produced a torque of 5.7 N·m with
90% rise and fall times of 48 ± 1 ms and 30 ± 2 ms, respectively (Fig. 3A). The delay in initial torque response (10% rise and fall times
of 24 ± 1 ms and 17 ± 2 ms, respectively) is primarily due to the delays intentionally added to ensure reliable spring retention
(fig. S11). The actuator can modulate the parallel-elastic torque by engaging more or fewer springs from the array (Fig. 3B and movie S3).
An individual spring can be engaged and disengaged at a frequency of 12 Hz (Fig. 3C and movie S4), similar to the bandwidth of

Cyclic actuation

We evaluated the prototype energy-recycling actuator on a set of cyclic test cases with dynamics that encapsulate the relevant features 
of a wide range of robotic tasks. We tested sinusoidal trajectories with two different masses and periods, a trajectory with rapid 
accelerations, a trajectory in which the payload changed mid-cycle, and a trajectory involving intermittent, forceful contact with a rigid 
surface (Fig. 4, movie S5, and fig. S17). To highlight the benefits of controlled parallel springs, we chose trajectories with combinations 
of position and torque that required no net work over the cycle. These conditions occur frequently in robotic systems, for example, when 
holding a static load, walking on a level surface, or picking and placing an object at the same height. In tasks with inherent 
positive-work requirements, energy recycling still produces benefits, although the benefits comprise a smaller portion of overall energy use.

Coordinating spring engagements to minimize energy use over long periods of time presents a challenging control problem; springs that 
become under- or overstretched may no longer be able to provide torque to offload the motor. For each test case, we first used offline 
optimization to identify desirable sequences of spring engagements, disengagements, and displacements for the preplanned trajectory 
(figs. S18 and S19). The objective was to minimize the difference between the nominal required torque for the task and the total spring 
torque while ensuring that each spring followed a cyclical trajectory and stayed within displacement limits. We posed this as a discrete-time 
problem, in which spring engagements and disengagements were represented by binary variables (22), and then solved it as a mixed-integer 
quadratic program (23). When performing the movement, we used an online feedback controller to reduce error between the nominal offline 
displacement and measured displacement for each spring by shifting spring engagement and disengagement times (figs. S20 and S21). For online 
motor control, we used a computed torque controller (24), incorporating estimates of parallel spring torques and the inertial and gravitational 
torques required for the nominal trajectory. With this approach, offline spring planning accuracy does not affect online trajectory tracking 
by the motor. Dynamic trajectory testing

We compared the electrical power consumption of the energy-recycling actuator with that of a commercially available motor and gearbox. 
The motor, used in both systems, included an embedded control board with a dedicated microcontroller and three-phase driver chip that 
exhibited high baseline power consumption, about 2.4 W, even when the motor produced zero torque at rest. We did not include this baseline
cost when calculating electrical energy use so as to isolate the power associated with actuation. The energy-recycling actuator used 
electricity to power and control its high-voltage clutches, but this cost was low: between 0.23 and 0.39 W. For each task, the actuator 
or motor performed closed-loop position control, achieving root mean square errors of less than 0.75° and peak error of less than 2.0° in 
all cases. Each experiment began with springs unstretched and the arm at its lowest position, such that no stored potential energy was 
initially available. Each test was conducted for 16 cycles, with data from the final 10 cycles of steady-state behavior reported. 
The same hardware was used for all tests.


Test cases

We first tested two simple sinusoidal trajectories with the same amplitudes but different periods and payload masses (Fig. 4, A and B). This is an 
example of a set of tasks for which springs can provide most of the required torque passively but only if stiffness can be varied. In this 
case, the faster, heavier task had twice the frequency and six times the mass. The energy-recycling actuator reduced energy consumption by
50% in the low-mass case, which required very little power, and 97% in the high-mass case, which required high power. It did so by optimizing 
the number of engaged springs and their displacements to match task requirements. Other approaches to adjusting spring stiffness and neutral 
point (25, 26) could provide similar benefits but could not reduce energy consumption while producing the rapid changes in torque required 
for the remaining tasks.

We next tested a trajectory with step changes in acceleration of a moving load (Fig. 4C). Sharp changes in acceleration are often needed in 
robots, for example, when following a complex trajectory or rapidly reversing the direction of movement. The energy-recycling actuator quickly 
engaged and disengaged springs to switch between periods of high acceleration and deceleration, resulting in a 79% decrease in energy use. Other 
devices using springs and latches can reduce energy costs in tasks involving rapid acceleration from rest (27) but cannot produce the complex 
patterns of torque and movement needed to track the trajectory in this task.

We next tested a trajectory with step changes in gravitational load (Fig. 4D). Hybrid dynamics of this type occur frequently when interacting 
with objects or the environment (28). In this case, the actuated arm moved into contact with a secondary load and then advanced it along a 
prescribed trajectory. By engaging prestretched springs while in contact with the mass, the energy-recycling actuator reduced power consumption 
by 85%. A simple parallel spring could not produce the pattern of torque and displacement required for this task, because desired torque 
increases as the spring recoils. A specialized spring mechanism could be designed to provide similar energy savings (29) but would increase 
energy requirements in the other tasks. Lastly, we tested a trajectory that included both position tracking and production of a static force 
against the environment (Fig. 4E). Contact with stiff surfaces, like the ground, a touchscreen, or a depressed button, requires control of
contact forces without changing position. In this case, the actuated arm followed a prescribed trajectory, lightly came into contact with
a load cell, applied a large force, and then lifted off. Force control was accurate for both the energy-recycling actuator and the motor,
with a root mean square error of less than 3% measured by the load cell after a settling period of 75 ms (fig. S14). By engaging springs 
to produce most of the required static force, the energy-recycling actuator reduced power consumption by 66%. Systems that use motors to
adjust parallel springs can also provide static forces economically once adjusted (25, 26), but the energy required to move the spring 
into position would outweigh the energy saved in the motor for brief contacts like the one in this task.

Transient behavior

Although steady-state conditions are required to achieve optimal energy savings, large savings can be obtained within the first few cycles
after transitioning to a new behavior. In every test case, near-optimal energy savings were achieved by the fourth cycle (Fig. 5 and fig. 
S15). By the second cycle, large energy savings were achieved for all but one test case (the low-mass sinusoid, which required the least 
motor energy to start with and therefore was most difficult to improve). During the first cycle, energy cost did not differ substantially 
between motor-only and energy-recycling conditions. In each test, all springs were initialized to their most relaxed state, meaning that 
they had no stored energy that could be used in the first cycle. In each test, the initial movement of the joint was in the direction that
would have led to further shortening of the springs, meaning that the springs could not initially be used to offset motor braking torques. 
Under typical real-world conditions, we would instead expect a robot to be transitioning from one behavior to another, leaving springs 
positioned to immediately provide stored energy or assist with braking. Together, these results suggest that energy recycling will often 
produce large benefits, and at worst leave energy cost unchanged, within the first few cycles of a new task after transitioning from any 
prior task. For similar reasons, large energy savings might even be expected during sequences of unrelated single-shot movements.

DISCUSSION

Comparison with parallel elastic actuators

The energy-recycling actuator provides greater versatility than prior parallel spring mechanisms because it decouples spring torque from 
joint angle. There is some correlation between the required torque and position for each task we tested, but the correlation across all 
test cases taken together is low (Fig. 6). Linear parallel springs optimized for each task individually could reduce torque requirements 
in most cases, but a spring optimized across all five test cases would only reduce the mean squared torque by 64% in the best case and 
would increase the mean squared torque by a factor of 3 in the worst case (fig. S22) with similar effects on energy consumption (fig. S23). 
By dynamically adjusting spring torque independently from joint configuration, the energy-recycling actuator reduced mean squared motor 
torque by at least 79% in all cases and by 99% in the best case. These results are consistent with our prior simulation study, which found 
similar reductions in torque and electrical energy consumption across 100 randomly generated task patterns (22).

Mechanical work and power consumption

Curiously, although the motor in the energy-recycling actuator always consumed substantially less electrical energy, it also typically 
performed more net mechanical work than when operating alone. The parallel springs greatly reduce motor torque (Fig. 6) and thereby electrical 
energy use. Each time a parallel spring is engaged or disengaged, however, a small amount of elastic energy is lost as other elements in 
the system stretch slightly (fig. S13). For example, each engage-disengage cycle of the bandwidth test reduced spring torque by about 5% and 
stored energy by about 13%. This increases the total work required to complete the task, thereby increasing the net positive work the motor 
must produce (fig. S24). For example, in the test case with intermittent contact, net work input from the motor each cycle increased from 
0.24 J for motor-only actuation to 0.93 J with the energy-recycling actuator, whereas electrical energy consumption decreased from 17 to 4
J. The small energy costs of clutching are outweighed by the large benefits of reduced motor torque and heat.


The energy-recycling actuator can reduce power consumption even for tasks that do not involve negative work. Parallel springs can be used
to offload the motor during periods of static torque production, as in the intermittent contact test case (Fig. 4E). Because motor energy
loss is proportional to the square of torque, the springs can even save energy by capturing and returning energy from the motor itself; 
energy produced economically at low torque can be stored and later used to offset expensive periods of high torque, a strategy that can be 
observed in the patterns of spring engagement for the variable payload task (Fig. 4D).

Variable transmission analogy

The energy-recycling actuator has functionality similar to that of a continuously variable transmission placed between a spring and a 
joint. In theory, such an arrangement would allow spring torque contributions to be controlled independently from spring stretch by 
varying the gear ratio. Unfortunately, continuously variable transmissions rely on rolling contact, which leads to unfavorable trade-offs 
among size, torque capacity, and shifting costs in complex cyclic applications, which we observed in preliminary work. The present design 
substitutes discrete changes in transmission configuration for continuous ones, resulting in a small reduction in the precision of spring 
torque control but a large improvement in tribological conditions. Electroadhesive clutches have almost no mass and allow springs to be 
engaged and disengaged for almost no energy cost, which makes it practical to include many individually controlled springs, approximating 
the continuous case. "
