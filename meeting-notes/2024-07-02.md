## Notes

- f-score implementation status?
  - this is taking a long time, please reach out if you are stuck and not sure how to make progress
  - we can't move on to the next steps until this is done
- share manual labels

## Goals

- upload manually-assigned expert labels (.xlsx) to github
- finish f-score implementation
  - we need a list of lists so that we can calculate the f-score for each article, one at a time
  - clean up the list of manual labels so that we are only considering individuals instead of "researchers" as a broad label
- @kat: draft a nanohub submission notebook
