## Administrative

- Abdikarim is stepping away from the project to focus on classes
- Meeting time: Tuesdays and Thursdays at 1 PM EST

## Project Details

- langchain quickstart status?

### Given a news article, how do we connect it to LLMs?

- get a local installation of langchain
- running the example script `langchain-rag-qa.py`
  - this requires a running ollama server
  - this article is from [here](https://apnews.com/article/record-hot-summer-climate-change-tree-rings-626d935d1f7266bb359d93074f52f10c)

## Next Steps

- using news API to save an article: [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)
  - register for an API key, use their python client to get an article
  - we can't get the full article content through the API
  - get the article URL from the API, and then load with langchain
- using langchain: 
  - base option: [WebBaseLoader](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/document_loaders/web_base/)
  - try [NewsURLLoader](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/document_loaders/news/)
  - use the procedure from [[2024-04-11]] to use this article as context to the local LLM
