## Review from Last Meeting 

- Have you created a class method that invokes a prompt with LangChain?
- Adding the latest code to GitHub would be helpful in preparation for our Friday meeting

## Solving a Research Question

- Hypothesis -> Sources -> Methods

### Hypothesis

> What biases exist in the selection of "experts" for science-related news articles?

### Identify Sources

- What are the sources for the news articles?
- How are we going to sample the sources?

### Gathering Data

- We will use an API to obtain recent news data
- News API: https://newsapi.org/

### Building a Data Structure

- Create a data structure to collect the information (our `Article` class)
    - Document article details (title, publisher, date, topic)
    - Document expert information (expert opinion Y/N, institution, location of institution, expert content)

## Goals

- Start working on a presentation that addresses each of the bullets in "Identify Sources", "Gather Data", "Building a Data Structure"
- Add a few by-hand examples to the presentation: find an article, fill the data structure manually (no code), document in the presentation
