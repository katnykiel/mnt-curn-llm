## Git Commit Review

- Walk through the process of making a git commit from VSCode
- stage, commit, pull, push, resolve merge
- upload your documents you have so far

## News Article Sources

- Did you look into data sources for our news articles?

## News Article Data Structure

- If we are going to track how experts are cited in news articles, we need a robust way to store this information
- We want to think of our data structure in terms on inputs and outputs
- This aids with the reproducability of the workflow

### Implementation

- For now, implement with a python class
- Below see an example of a class called "Complex" which contains real and imaginary parts

```python
# define our class
class Complex:
    def __init__(self, realpart, imagpart):
        self.r = realpart
        self.i = imagpart
```

- We will use class methods to obtain outputs from the text
- For example, we can add the following to our class above:

```python
    ...
    def get_complex_number_string(self):
        return f"{self.r} + {self.i}i"

x = Complex(3.0, 4.5)
x.get_complex_number_string()
# 3.0 + 4.5i

```

- We will create a class method that uses LLMs to get expert citations
- Later we will implement this class with a Sim2L on nanoHUB

### Inputs

- article text
- article metadata
  - news source
  - date published

### Outputs

- list of expert references, where each reference contains
  - expert name
  - expert institution


## Goals

- Write a python script that defines our data structure according to the details above
- Create a class method that allows you to manually add an reference
- Create a class method to write the object information to a file, for later use
- Choose an article, create an instance of your class and use your class methods to write a file

### Example Implementation

```python
test_article = Article(text="...", ...)
test_article.add_expert_reference({"name":"Dr. Feynman", "Affiliation":"MIT"})
test_article.write_file("test_article.txt")
```
