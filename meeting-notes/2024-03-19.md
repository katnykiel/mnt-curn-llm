## Review from last meeting

- What's your progress on adding a news article to the system prompt?
- Making a document and adding it to the git repository

## Adding files to git repository

- VSCode offers a fairly simple Git integration, but fundamentals are still useful
- a few basic concepts:
    - **Repository**: A directory where Git tracks changes to your files.
    - **Clone**: Create a local copy of a remote repository.
    - **Stage**: Choose which changes you want to track.
    - **Commit**: Save changes to the repository with a descriptive message.
    - **Push**: Upload local commits to a remote repository.
    - **Pull**: Fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into the current branch.
    - **Fetch**: Download changes from a remote repository without merging them.
