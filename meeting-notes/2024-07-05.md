## Notes

- new branch - API key was pushed, you need to change your API key
- nanoHUB will only support requesting CPUs, not GPUs - this makes it much slower to run local LLMs
- we can run on Gilbreth using A100 GPUs - using the same python scripts that we've been using

### Benchmarking LLM Retrieval with F-Score

- we can test multiple LLMs and compare their relative f-score with this particular task

### Identifying Trends in Expert Affiliations

- connect the LLM-generated list of experts and their institutions to code written in a past project ([on github](https://github.com/katnykiel/news_analysis))

## Goals

- work through the `workflow.ipynb` file in the repository linked above
  - understand the last 4 code cells that analyze institutions affiliated with experts
  - try to connect this to our current list of manually-labeled experts
