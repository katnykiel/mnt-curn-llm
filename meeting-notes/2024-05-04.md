## Project Overview

### Research Question

> What biases exist in the selection of "experts" for science-related news articles?

- sample a representative distribution of news articles
- use LLMs to scrape data on expert references
  - compare against hand-labeled dataset
  - quantify how well LLMs perform (precision/recall)

### Current Status

- established a basic system for interacting with news articles with LLMs with langchain / ollama

### Remainder of Project

- start creating a database of news articles, carefully documented
- after creating the database, use our LLM system to get expert references
- analyze the data on these experts

## Next Steps

- I'll be out of town this Thursday, but you two should meet and update each other on project progress

### Abdikarim

- upload the latest version of the `Article` class to github, with llm class method

### Bryan

- understand the `Article` class and use it to analyze a news article you find, by hand (no API)
