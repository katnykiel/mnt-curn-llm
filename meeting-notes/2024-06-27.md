## Notes

- f-score implementation?
- nanoHUB workflow isn't an option, we can't run ollama there
  - we could submit jobs to Purdue's supercomputers through nanoHUB
  - alternatively, Kat can run them on Purdue's supercomputers without much hassle

## Goals

- create a write-up of different prompts and their f-scores
