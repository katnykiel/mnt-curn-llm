## Meeting Notes

- let's complete the workflow today
  - get articles from NewsAPI
  - save article metadata
  - get URLs from article metadata
  - pass URLs to langchain document loaders
  - prompt articles for information using `chat.invoke()`
- upload code to github from bryan's computer

## Next Steps

- write a python script to calculate [F-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score)
  - we are comparing the predictions of the LLM against the manually obtained results
  - instruct the models to give clear, structured outputs
  - we will need to match strings to see how well they agree
  - do this for both the expert and their institution
  - sample python function to call: [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html)
- test out multiple prompt structures, models and evaluate their F-score
