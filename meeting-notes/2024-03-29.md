## Review from Last Meeting

- What's your progress on adding a news article to the system prompt?

## Research Strategy

- Hypothesis -> Sources -> Methods

### Hypothesis

- Generally, our topic of research is to explore how news articles cite experts and identify bias in these references
- We want to narrow down our research question

### Identify Sources

- What are the sources for the news articles? Make sure we are getting unbiased news sources and a large dataset.
- How are we going to sample the sources? Randomly? How?
- Start by hand, do human tests, read 10 articles from our sampling method

### Building a Data Structure

- Create a data structure to collect the information, ensuring it is a reproducible workflow that others can replicate.
- The data structure should specify who or what read the article.
- After assembling the data, we review it and ensure we agree on its content.
- Document relevant information (expert opinion Y/N, institution, location of institution)
